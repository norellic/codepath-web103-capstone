## About

### Description and Purpose

Beam is a gamified habit and task tracker that visualizes progress in a fun and interactive way. As users complete tasks, they earn points that can be spent to customize an in-game creature or environment. Visual feedback, rewards, and customization motivate consistent task completion while allowing users to track their achievements over time.
The purpose of Beam is to help users build consistent, healthy habits through gamification and visual progress. By tying task completion to rewards, customization, and visual feedback, the app encourages focus, accountability, and satisfaction. 

### Inspiration

Habit tracking apps with a visual representation of progress ‚Äì examples include ‚ÄúPlant Nanny‚Äù, an app that lets you track you water consumption and use it to water virtual plants, and  ‚ÄúFinch,‚Äù where checking off to-do list items earns points you can spend on accessories for your in-game pet.
