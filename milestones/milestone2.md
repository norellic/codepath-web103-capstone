## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Our group was able to get the ball rolling with clear ideas of what we wanted our website/app to look like. We discussed layouts, features, and design elements early on, which helped us visualize the overall direction of our project and stay organized as we moved forward.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

One of the main challenges we faced was paying attention to the small details that would make our website more engaging and appealing to users. We also had to think carefully about customer behavior, understanding what users might want or expect when navigating the app, which took time and thoughtful planning.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We may need additional guidance on improving the user interface and user experience design aspects of our project. Support in conducting user testing or receiving feedback on our layout and functionality would also help us refine our website/app to make it more intuitive and user-friendly.
