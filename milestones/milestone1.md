## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Our brainstorming process went really well. Everyone in the group contributed their thoughts and ideas, which helped us narrow down a solid direction for our project. We were able to collaborate effectively and communicate our goals clearly, which made it easier to get started.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Interestingly, brainstorming was both our strength and our challenge. We had a lot of different ideas, and it was sometimes difficult to choose which one to focus on. It took time for everyone to agree on a final concept and ensure that it was realistic to complete within the given timeframe. In addition, we suspect occasional struggles with scheduling conflicts and making sure everyone is on the same page about the technical aspects of our plan.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

As we move forward, we could use more guidance on how to code and implement some of the new ideas we want to include in our application. Having examples or tutorials related to similar projects would help us strengthen our technical approach. It would also be helpful to have a bit more dedicated time to work together as a group, so we can refine our ideas, troubleshoot issues, and make sure our project stays on track.
