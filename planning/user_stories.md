# User Stories

Reference the Writing User Stories final project guide in the course portal for more information about how to complete each of the sections below.

## Outline User Roles

1. Student: with many tasks they need to organize
2. New Grad/Young Adult: with unstructured time they need to plan

## Draft User Stories

1. As a new grad trying to build healthy habits, I want a tool that will allow me to visualize the time I spend dedicated towards my goals.
2. As a student with a long and varied to do list, I want a place to keep track of all my tasks so I can stay organized.
3. As a new grad learning to manage my time independently, I want a way to track and celebrate small wins, so that I can stay motivated and recognize progress even when larger goals feel far away.
4. As a new grad lacking motivation, I want my focus sessions and task completions to translate into in-app rewards or growth, so that I feel like my effort tangibly builds something over time.
5. As student who values aesthetic satisfaction, I want the visualization of my progress to be beautiful and calming, so that opening the app feels rewarding and reflective rather than stressful.
6. As a student who enjoys gamified structure, I want my habits and tasks to impact a virtual ecosystem, so that I associate productivity with care and positive reinforcement.
7. As a new grad who wants accountability, I want the app to respond to my engagementâ€”whether through progress decay or gentle reminders, so that I feel a sense of responsibility to maintain my virtual world.
8. As a goal-oriented new grad, I want to quantify my progress through clear metrics, so that I can measure growth and set meaningful targets.
9. As a student, I want to customize my task categories, visual themes, or icons, so that my to-do list feels personal and reflects my mindset or aesthetic preferences.
10. As a new grad, I want to review past streaks, milestones, or visual changes in my world, so that I can appreciate long-term consistency and feel proud of my journey.
